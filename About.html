                Hello, my name is Daniela. I have a strong passion for competitive video and online gaming, where I enjoy the strategic and
                fast-paced nature of the experience. Outside of gaming, I have a deep appreciation for spicy foods and the culinary challenge
                they bring. I’m also an avid cat enthusiast, drawn to their unique personalities and companionship.
                In addition to these interests, I am a hobbyist programmer and artist. I’ve studied and gained experience 
                with web development and programming languages such as C#, Java, C++, and C. My creative endeavors in art complement my technical skills, 
                allowing me to approach challenges with both logic and innovation. I thrive on continuous learning and exploring new opportunities to apply 
                my skills and passions.
            </p>
