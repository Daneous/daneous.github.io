            <h2>Daniela</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Daniela! 🎮👩‍💻 I’m a competitive gamer who loves 
                the adrenaline of online battles and the strategy they demand. 
                When I’m not gaming, you’ll often find me savoring some seriously 
                spicy food—because why not add a little heat to life? 🌶️🔥 Cats 
                are another passion of mine; their quirky personalities never fail to bring me joy. 🐱
                I’m also a hobbyist programmer and artist, combining logic and creativity to 
                explore new ideas. I’ve delved into web development and languages like C#, Java, 
                C++, and C, crafting projects that keep my skills sharp. Whether it’s sketching,
                 coding, or gaming, I’m always chasing new challenges and inspiration! Let’s chat 
                 about tech, art, or the latest spicy dish I should try!
